Hi there! I’m a passionate Elixir and Phoenix developer with over 6 years of experience in building scalable, high-performance systems for startups and SaaS platforms. I’ve worked across industries like e-commerce, telecommunications, and AI, where I’ve developed and contributed to everything from Elixir packages to API frameworks.

I’m mostly self-taught, with a deep interest in back-end development and real-time web applications using Phoenix LiveView. I’ve also explored Python and JavaScript, and I enjoy solving complex problems with modern tech stacks. In addition to writing clean, efficient code, I love sharing my knowledge through tutorials and how-to articles.

When I’m not coding, you can find me experimenting with new tech, contributing to open-source projects, or mentoring other developers.


*Welcome to my blog, where I’ll be sharing tips, projects, and insights about Elixir, Phoenix, and other cool tech!*
